# Setting Up

Setting up Clojure + Amazonica + Simpleworkflow is just a matter of creating a
new project and including the apporpriate dependencies. The easiest way to get
set up initially is to clone this project:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:clojusc/amazonica-swf-examples.git
$ cd amazonica-swf-examples
```
